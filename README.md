# advanced-software-development-for-robotics The goal of this practical work is get familiar with soft real-time and hard real-time software development, and the combination of it, in the context of controlling robotic/mechatronic systems, i.e. physicalmachines.

For the soft real-time part (Assignment set 1 and 3), we use ROS2 (Robotic Operating System 2), version Humble, heavily used in modern robotics. The algorithms are programmed in C++.

For the hard real-time part (Assignment sets 2 and 3), we work with a Raspberry Pi 4, using a specifically tuned Linux (Raspberry Pi OS with the Xenomai real-time patch) and programs written in C++. In Assignment set 2, only the bare Raspberry Pi is needed, without additional hardware. In Assignment set 3 a robotic system
(a two-DOF webcammovement unit) is controlled with the Raspberry Pi.
